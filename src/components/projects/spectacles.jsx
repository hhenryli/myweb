                Order Up! is an augmented reality game I developed in an independent work seminar
                at Princeton. The game is inspired by games such as Overcooked!, Diner Dash, and Family Style.
              </p>
              <p className='font-garamond text-s text-start mt-4'>The goal of this seminar was to study the use of an augmented reality application in a colocated, social environment.</p>

            <p className='font-garamond text-s text-start mt-4'>Lens Studio was the main method to develop, which was a bit difficult and different compared to Unity. There were a lot more factors to consider like how the Spectacles experience would be, performance, and taking that physical space into account.</p>
